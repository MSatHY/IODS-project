Open data science is a massive open online course (MOOC) revolving around three major themes:

1. Open Data
2. Data Science
3. Open Science 

Each week the students will finish two course exercises and give feedback to a fellow student. The course utilizes R-language which will be learned in the weekly exercises done at https://www.datacamp.com/. The data wrangling exercises will be collected to a course diary and published online at https://github.com/. Here is a [link](https://github.com/MSatHY/IODS-project) to my Github repository.
